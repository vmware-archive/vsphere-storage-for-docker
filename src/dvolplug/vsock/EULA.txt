Either party may terminate this Agreement at any time for any reason or no reason by providing the other party advance written notice thereof.  VMware hereby terminates this Agreement and any Licensee rights with respect to the Beta Software without notice in the event of improper disclosure of VMware’s Beta Software as specified under Section 4 (Confidentiality) below. Upon any expiration or termination of this Agreement, the rights and licenses granted to Licensee under this Agreement shall immediately terminate, and Licensee shall immediately cease using, and will destroy or render practically inaccessible the Beta Software, Documentation, and all other tangible items in Licensee’s possession or control that contain Confidential Information.

4.	CONFIDENTIALITY.  
       (a) "Confidential Information" shall mean the Beta Software, all information regarding the Beta Software (including any trade secrets, know-how, inventions, techniques, processes, and algorithms embodied in the Beta Software), Documentation, Performance Data, any Updates, and other information provided by VMware to Licensee under this Agreement, whether disclosed orally, in writing, or by examination or inspection, other than information that Licensee can demonstrate (i) was already known to Licensee, other than under an obligation of confidentiality, at the time of disclosure; (ii) was generally available in the public domain at the time of disclosure to Licensee; (iii) became generally available in the public domain after disclosure other than through any act or omission of Licensee; (iv) was subsequently lawfully disclosed to Licensee by a third party without any obligation of confidentiality; or (v) was independently developed by Licensee without use of or reference to any information or materials disclosed by VMware or its suppliers.  If Licensee is required to disclose Confidential Information by applicable law or court order, Licensee shall notify VMware of the required disclosure promptly in writing and shall cooperate with VMware in any lawful action to contest or limit the scope of the required disclosure.  Confidential Information shall include without limitation any information relating to VMware products, product roadmaps, and other technical, business, financial and product development plans, forecasts and strategies.  Licensee shall not use any Confidential Information for any purpose other than as expressly authorized under this Agreement.  In no event shall Licensee use the Beta Software or any Confidential Information to develop, manufacture, market, sell, or distribute any product or service, including any VMware products except as expressly set forth in this Agreement.  Licensee shall not disclose any Confidential Information to any third party. Without limiting the foregoing, Licensee shall use at least the same degree of care that it uses to prevent the disclosure of its own confidential information of like importance, but in no event less than reasonable care, to prevent the disclosure of such Confidential Information.
       (b)  Additional Confidentiality Restrictions for Highly Confidential Beta Software.  For certain Beta Software designated by VMware as highly confidential (“Highly Confidential Beta Software”) in VMware’s correspondence to you regarding this beta program or in any Documentation, additional heightened confidentiality restrictions designated below will apply, in addition to accepting the terms of this Agreement.
       (i)  Licensee shall limit dissemination of Highly Confidential Beta Software and related information concerning product features, future technologies and roadmaps only to Information Technology teams and/or software/solutions development teams of Licensee designated by VMware, and only to individuals on those teams who have a need to know the Confidential Information for purposes expressly authorized under this Agreement.  For clarity and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Licensee shall not disseminate any Highly Confidential Beta Software to Licensee's sales and marketing field organizations.  Licensee will assign an employee who will be primarily responsible (“Primary Contact”) for ensuring that the terms of this Agreement are complied with.  
       (ii)  Improper Disclosure of Highly Confidential Beta Software.  Licensee acknowledges that damages for improper disclosure of Highly Confidential Beta Software or related information concerning product features, future technologies and roadmaps may be irreparable and that monetary damages would be inadequate to compensate VMware for any breach of this Agreement.  In the event that VMware reasonably believes that Licensee has disseminated certain of such Highly Confidential Beta Software or related information concerning product features, future technologies and roadmaps to an unauthorized party, Licensee will be immediately removed from VMware’s Beta Software program and will not be permitted to participate in any VMware Beta Software program in the future.  Additionally, all rights and licenses granted to Licensee under this Agreement shall immediately terminate in accordance with Section 3 herein (Term and Termination), and (b) in addition to all other remedies available in law or otherwise, VMware is entitled to seek equitable relief, including injunction and preliminary injunction against the threatened breach of this Agreement or  the continuation of any such breach. 
5.	LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.  IT IS UNDERSTOOD THAT THE BETA SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED WITHOUT CHARGE FOR LIMITED EVALUATION PURPOSES.  ACCORDINGLY, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, BUT SUBJECT ALWAYS TO THIS SECTION 5, THE TOTAL LIABILITY OF VMWARE AND ITS LICENSORS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT SHALL NOT EXCEED $100.00.  TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL VMWARE OR ITS LICENSORS HAVE LIABILITY FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OR DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF BUSINESS PROFITS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, OR LOSS OF BUSINESS INFORMATION, HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, TORT, STATUTE, CONTRACT OR OTHER), EVEN IF VMWARE AND ITS LICENSORS HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.  THESE LIMITATIONS SHALL APPLY NOTWITHSTANDING ANY FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY LIMITED REMEDY.  THE PARTIES ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE VARIOUS CONSIDERATIONS DUE TO VMWARE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT WERE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT IN DETERMINING THE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SET FORTH IN THIS SECTION 5. LICENSEE ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THIS LIMITATION IS AN ESSENTIAL ELEMENT OF THIS AGREEMENT AND THAT VMWARE WOULD NOT ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT WITHOUT THESE LIMITATIONS ON ITS LIABILITY.

6.	WARRANTY DISCLAIMER.  IT IS UNDERSTOOD THAT THE BETA SOFTWARE, OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE, DOCUMENTATION, AND ANY UPDATES MAY CONTAIN ERRORS AND ARE PROVIDED FOR LIMITED EVALUATION ONLY.

TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, AND SUBJECT TO SECTION 5, VMWARE AND ITS LICENSORS SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIM ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, NONINFRINGEMENT, AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  Licensee acknowledges that VMware has not publicly announced the availability of the Beta Software, that such Beta Software may contain features currently under development, that VMware has not promised or guaranteed to Licensee that such Beta Software will be announced or made available to anyone in the future, that VMware has no express or implied obligation to Licensee to announce or introduce the Beta Software, that VMware might not introduce a product similar to or compatible with the Beta Software, and that any version number (if any) referenced is subject to change and does not in any way represent VMware’s commitment to release any product in the future. Accordingly, Licensee acknowledges that any research or development that it performs regarding the Beta Software or any product associated with the Beta Software is done entirely at Licensee’s own risk.  Specifically, the Beta Software may contain features, functionality or modules that will not be included in the production version of the Beta Software, if released, or that will be marketed separately for additional fees.
