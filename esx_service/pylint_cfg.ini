# Disable the message, report, category or checker with the given id(s). You
# can either give multiple identifiers separated by comma (,) or put this
# option multiple times (only on the command line, not in the configuration
# file where it should appear only once).You can also use "--disable=all" to
# disable everything first and then reenable specific checks. For example, if
# you want to run only the similarities checker, you can use "--disable=all
# --enable=similarities". If you want to run only the classes checker, but have
# no Warning level messages displayed, use"--disable=all --enable=classes
# --disable=W"

#:C0103 (invalid-name): *Invalid %s name "%s"*
#Used when the name doesn't match the regular expression associated to its type
#(constant, variable, class...). This message belongs to the basic checker.

#:E0604 (invalid-all-object): *Invalid object %r in __all__, must contain only strings*
#Used when an invalid (non-string) object occurs in __all__. This message belongs to the variables checker.

#:E0611 (no-name-in-module): *No name %r in module %r*
#Used when a name cannot be found in a module. This message belongs to the variables checker.

#:E1002 (super-on-old-class): *Use of super on an old style class*
#Used when an old style class uses the super builtin. This message belongs to the newstyle checker.

#:E1101 (no-member): *%s %r has no %r member*
#Used when a variable is accessed for an unexistent member. This message belongs to the typecheck checker.

#:E1103 (maybe-no-member): *%s %r has no %r member (but some types could not be inferred)*
#Used when a variable is accessed for an unexistent member, but astroid was not
#able to interpret all possible types of this variable. This message belongs to the typecheck checker.

#:F0220 (unresolved-interface): *failed to resolve interfaces implemented by %s (%s)*
#Used when a PyLint as failed to find interfaces implemented by a class This message belongs to the classes checker.

# Used when an inline option disables a message or a messages category.

#:R0201 (no-self-use): *Method could be a function*
#Used when a method doesn't use its bound instance, and so could be written as
#a function. This message belongs to the classes checker.

#:R0801 (duplicate-code): *Similar lines in %s files*
#Indicates that a set of similar lines has been detected among multiple file.
#This usually means that the code should be refactored to avoid this
#duplication. This message belongs to the similarities checker.

#A class implements some of the special methods for a particular protocol, but
#not all of them This message belongs to the design checker.

#:W0142 (star-args): *Used * or ** magic*
#Used when a function or method is called using `*args` or `**kwargs` to

#care. This message belongs to the basic checker.

#:W0201 (attribute-defined-outside-init): *Attribute %r defined outside __init__*
#Used when an instance attribute is defined outside the __init__ method. This message belongs to the classes checker.

#:W0212 (protected-access): *Access to a protected member %s of a client class*
#Used when a protected member (i.e. class member with a name beginning with an
#underscore) is access outside the class or a descendant of the class where
#it's defined. This message belongs to the classes checker.

#:W0232 (no-init): *Class has no __init__ method*
#Used when a class has no __init__ method, neither its parent classes. This message belongs to the classes checker.

#unrelated errors. This message belongs to the exceptions checker.

#:W1001 (property-on-old-class): *Use of "property" on an old style class*
#Used when PyLint detect the use of the builtin "property" on an old style
