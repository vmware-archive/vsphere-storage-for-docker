Docker Volume Driver for vSphere
================================

This repo hosts the Docker Volume Driver for vSphere. Docker Volume Driver enables customers to address persistent storage requirements for Docker containers in vSphere environments. This plugin is integrated with [Docker Volume Plugin framework](https://docs.docker.com/engine/extend/plugins_volume/). Docker users can now consume vSphere Storage (vSAN, VMFS, NFS) to address persistency requirements of containerized cloud native apps using Docker Ecosystem.

## Download

We use [Github releases] (https://github.com/vmware/docker-volume-vsphere/releases).

The download consists of 2 parts

1. The ESX side code packaged as a [vib or an offline depot] (http://pubs.vmware.com/vsphere-60/index.jsp#com.vmware.vsphere.install.doc/GUID-29491174-238E-4708-A78F-8FE95156D6A3.html#GUID-29491174-238E-4708-A78F-8FE95156D6A3)
2. The VM side docker plugin packaged as a deb or rpm file.

Please pick the latest release and use the same version of ESX and VM release.

## Installation Instructions

### On ESX

Install vSphere Installation Bundle (VIB).  [Please refer to
vSphere documentation.](http://pubs.vmware.com/vsphere-60/index.jsp#com.vmware.vsphere.install.doc/GUID-29491174-238E-4708-A78F-8FE95156D6A3.html#GUID-29491174-238E-4708-A78F-8FE95156D6A3)

Install using localcli on an ESX node
```
esxcli software vib install --no-sig-check  -v /tmp/<vib_name>.vib
```

Make sure you provide the **absolute path** to the `.vib` file or the install will fail.

### On Docker Host (VM)

The Docker volume plugin requires the docker engine to be installed as a prerequisite. This requires
Ubuntu users to configure the docker repository and pull the `docker-engine` package from there.
Ubuntu users can find instructions [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/ubuntulinux/).

[Docker recommends that the docker engine should start after the plugins.] (https://docs.docker.com/engine/extend/plugin_api/)

```
sudo dpkg -i <name>.deb # Ubuntu or deb based distros
sudo rpm -ivh <name>.rpm # Photon or rpm based distros
```

## Using Docker CLI

```
$ docker volume create --driver=vmdk --name=MyVolume -o size=10gb
$ docker volume ls
$ docker volume inspect MyVolume
$ docker run --rm -it -v MyVolume:/mnt/myvol busybox
$ cd /mnt/myvol # to access volume inside container, exit to quit
$ docker volume rm MyVolume
```

## Using ESXi Admin CLI
```
$ /usr/lib/vmware/vmdkops/bin/vmdkops_admin.py ls
```

## Restarting Docker and Docker-Volume-vSphere plugin

The volume plugin needs to be started up before starting docker.

```
service docker stop
service docker-volume-vsphere restart
service docker start
```

using systemctl

```
systemctl stop docker
systemctl restart docker-volume-vsphere
systemctl start docker
```

## Logging
The relevant logging for debugging consists of

Docker logs: https://docs.docker.com/engine/admin/logging/overview/
```
/var/log/upstart/docker.log # Upstart
journalctl -fu docker.service # Journalctl/Systemd
```

VM Plugin logs
```
/var/log/docker-volume-vsphere.log
```

ESX Plugin logs
```
/var/log/vmware/vmdk_ops.log
```

## Tested on

VMware ESXi:
- 6.0
- 6.0 u1
- 6.0 u2

Docker: 1.9 and higher

Guest Operating System:
- [Photon 1.0 RC] (https://vmware.github.io/photon/) (Includes open-vm-tools)
- Ubuntu 14.04 or higher (64 bit)
   - Needs Upstart or systemctl to start and stop the plugin
   - Needs [open vm tools or VMware Tools installed](https://kb.vmware.com/selfservice/microsites/search.do?language=en_US&cmd=displayKC&externalId=340) ```sudo apt-get install open-vm-tools```

# Known Issues
1. Operations are serialized. Thus, if a large volume is created, other operations will block till the format is complete. [#35](/../../issues/35)
2. VM level snapshots do not include docker data volumes. [#60](/../../issues/60)
3. Exiting bug in Docker around cleanup if mounting of volume fails when -w command is passed. [Docker Issue #22564] (https://github.com/docker/docker/issues/22564)
4. VIB, RPM and Deb files are not signed.[#273](/../../issues/273)
